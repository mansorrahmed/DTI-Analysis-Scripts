## Data acquisition
A gradient table for the Siemens systems is included in the file *DiffusionVectors_RDSI_withb0.dvs*. This gradient scheme has 4 shells (250, 1000, 2250, 4000 s/mm2) with each 59 directions according the the paper indicated above. The directions are spread over the full sphere for eddy correction, are ordered to alternate shells to minimize gradient load, and are randomized for better motion correction. The gradient table includes 16 b0 spread throughout for a total of 252 volumes. The acquisition should be run with a b-value of 4000 s/mm2.

## Prerequisites for use of these scripts
* Matlab
* [DSIStudio](http://dsi-studio.labsolver.org/dsi-studio-download)

## External software packages used
* The [SPAMS](http://spams-devel.gforge.inria.fr/downloads.html) (SPArse Modeling Software) package. An older version of this package is included in this repository. The necessary MacOS (MacOS X Maverick (10.9.5) and Linux-binaries are included. You might have to recompile the mex-files for your system.
* Selected files from the [MIRT](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~fessler/irt/irt/) (Michigan Image Reconstruction Toolbox) package by [Jeff Fessler](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~fessler/) are included in this repository.
	
## Processing steps

### Obtaining the code
Download from [cai2r.net -> Resources -> Software Downloads](https://www.cai2r.net/resources/software/radial-dsi-reconstruction-matlab-code) or clone the repository from [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/sbaete/rdsi_recon)

	git clone https://bitbucket.org/sbaete/rdsi_recon.git

### Example processing
Example processing scripts can be found in *rdsi_phantomas_example.m* and *rdsi_example.m*. Phantom data for the first script, generated with [Phantomas](http://www.emmanuelcaruyer.com/phantomas.php), is included in the *demodata*-subfolder. With the second script, you can process your own (human) data.

In both *rdsi_phantomas_example.m* and *rdsi_example.m*, make sure the *dsistudiocmd*-variable points to the location where dsistudio-executable.

	dsistudiocmd ='/usr/local/dsistudio/dsi_studio_20170908/dsi_studio';

For *rdsi_example.m*, it is assumed that the diffusion data is preprocessed according to individual taste (denoising, gibbs ringing correction, eddy current correction, motion correction, etc) to a nii.gz-file named in the *inputnii*-variable and that the *inputnii* is accompanied by an FSL-style *data.bvec* and *data.bval*-file.

	inputnii = ['/Exp/rdsi_scripts/data.nii.gz'];
	
	ls /Exp/rdsi_scripts/data/
	data.bval  data.bvec  data.nii.gz
	
In addition, set the the folder where you would like the output to be generated in the *outfold*-variable.

	outfold = '/Exp/rdsi_scripts/data/';

The script will automatically generate a dsistudio *src.gz*-file for further reconstruction. If this would not work on your system, you can perform this step directly using DSIStudio to create the following file.

	/Exp/rdsi_scripts/data/data.src.gz

The actual RDSI reconstruction happens in *rdsi_recon.m*. The resulting *fib.gz*-file can be opened with DSIStudio for tractography. 

	/Exp/rdsi_scripts/data/data.src.gz.rdsi.fib.gz

QA-maps of the first, second and third identified direction will be exported by the script to nifti-files with respective suffixes *.fa0.nii.gz*, *.fa1.nii.gz* and *.fa2.nii.gz*.

	QA1 -> /Exp/rdsi_scripts/data/data.src.gz.rdsi.fib.gz.fa0.nii.gz
	QA2 -> /Exp/rdsi_scripts/data/data.src.gz.rdsi.fib.gz.fa1.nii.gz
	QA3 -> /Exp/rdsi_scripts/data/data.src.gz.rdsi.fib.gz.fa2.nii.gz
