## Data acquisition
A gradient table for the Siemens systems is included in the file *DiffusionVectors_RDSI.dvs*. This gradient scheme has 4 shells with each 59 directions according the the paper indicated above. It should be run with a b-value of 4000 s/mm2.

## Prerequisites for use of these scripts
* Matlab
* [DSIStudio](http://dsi-studio.labsolver.org/dsi-studio-download)
* The [SPAMS](http://spams-devel.gforge.inria.fr/downloads.html) (SPArse Modeling Software) package. An older version of this package is included in this repository. The necessary MacOS (MacOS X Maverick (10.9.5) and Linux-binaries are included. You might have to recompile the mex-files for your system otherwise.
	
## Processing steps

### Obtaining the code
Download from cai2r.net -> Resources -> Software Downloads or clone the repository from bitbucket

	git clone https://sbaete@bitbucket.org/sbaete/rdsi_recon.git

### Example processing
An example processing script can be found in *rdsi_example.m*. 

It is assumed that the diffusion data is preprocessed according to individual taste (denoising, gibbs ringing correction, eddy current correction, motion correction, etc) to a nii.gz-file named in the *inputnii*-variable and that the *inputnii* is accompanied by an FSL-style *data.bvec* and *data.bval*-file.

	inputnii = ['/Exp/rdsi_scripts/data.nii.gz'];
	
	ls /Exp/rdsi_scripts/data/
	data.bval  data.bvec  data.nii.gz
	
In *rdsi_example.m*, also make sure *dsistudiocmd*-variable points to the location where dsistudio is installed. In addition, set the the folder where you would like the output to be generated in the *outfold*-variable.

	dsistudiocmd ='/usr/local/dsistudio/dsi_studio_20170908/dsi_studio';
	outfold = '/Exp/rdsi_scripts/data/';

The script will automatically generate a dsistudio *src.gz*-file for further reconstruction. If this would not work on your system, you can perform this step directly using DSIStudio.

	/Exp/rdsi_scripts/data/data.src.gz

The actual RDSI reconstruction happens in *rdsi_recon.m*. The resulting *fib.gz*-file can be opened with DSIStudio for tractography. 

	/Exp/rdsi_scripts/data/data.src.gz.fib.gz

QA-maps of the first, second and third identified direction will be exported by the script to nifti-files with respective suffixes *.fa0.nii.gz*, *.fa1.nii.gz* and *.fa2.nii.gz*.

	QA1 -> /Exp/rdsi_scripts/data/data.src.gz.fib.gz.fa0.nii.gz
	QA2 -> /Exp/rdsi_scripts/data/data.src.gz.fib.gz.fa1.nii.gz
	QA3 -> /Exp/rdsi_scripts/data/data.src.gz.fib.gz.fa2.nii.gz
